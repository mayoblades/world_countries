A simple approach to Web-Scraping Tables in Wikipedia pages:
Many people use BeautifulSoup to webscrape, but pandas have a handy  read_html() function  which is a quick and convenient way to turn an HTML table into a pandas DataFrame. 

This function can be useful for quickly incorporating tables from various websites without figuring out how to scrape the siteâ€™s HTML. 

However, there can be some challenges in cleaning and formatting the data before analyzing it. But that can be sorted out easily using iloc and loc.
